# Let’s create a video game
This is video game project is built by The Book Of Memento’s community, as we work together on our own video game on https://www.twitch.tv/thebookofmemento. 
Feel free to join the livestream each sunday at 4pm !

## Pitch of the game - The book of Guide
You are a young traveler taking care of an agonizing animal. Your goal is to survive together in the forest during one week. The game is a poetic and narrative point-and-click adventure, where you have to look for ressources while avoiding dangers of the forest.

The whole game happens in one single place : The campfire where the beast lies. The traveler comes and goes exploring the forest or gathering resources.
